# Distributed Web Infrastructure

This web structure addresses the issues encountered in the simple web stack, such as depending on one server or requiring a restart or shutdown of the entire website system for deploying new code.

However, the distributed web infrastructure still faces or lacks many features that can make it more reliable:

- **Firewall Absence:** The absence of firewalls that control incoming traffic and block those that violate predefined rules can put the website at a security risk of getting hacked. :lock:

- **HTTPS Absence:** The lack of HTTPS to protect the exchange of data between the server and the browser makes it easy for third parties to intercept communication and access sensitive information. :warning:
