# Scaling Web Infrastructure Components

## Adding 1 Server

- **Reason:** Increased Capacity and Redundancy
- **Explanation:** :arrow_up: Adding a new server increases overall capacity, allowing the system to handle higher traffic volumes. It also provides redundancy, ensuring system availability even if one server fails.

## Adding 1 Load-Balancer (HAproxy) Configured as Cluster

- **Reason:** Load Distribution and High Availability
- **Explanation:** :balance_scale: Configuring HAproxy as a cluster with the existing load balancer ensures load distribution across multiple servers. This prevents overload on any single server and enhances high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other seamlessly takes over, minimizing downtime.

## Splitting Components (Web Server, Application Server, Database) with Their Own Server

- **Reason:** Scalability and Resource Isolation
- **Explanation:** :chart_with_upwards_trend: By separating components onto dedicated servers, you achieve better scalability and resource isolation. Each component can scale independently, improving overall performance. For instance, scaling the web server layer doesn't impact the application server or database, allowing efficient resource allocation.
