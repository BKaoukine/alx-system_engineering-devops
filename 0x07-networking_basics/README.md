# OSI Model :gear:

**What it is:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

**How many layers it has:** It has seven layers - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

**How it is organized:** The layers are organized from the bottom (Physical) to the top (Application), each responsible for specific functions in data communication.

# LAN (Local Area Network) :computer:

**What it is:** A LAN is a network limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or campus.

**Typical usage:** Used for connecting computers and devices within close proximity for local communication.

**Typical geographical size:** Typically covers a small area like a single building or campus.

# WAN (Wide Area Network) :earth_asia:

**What it is:** A WAN is a network that spans a broad area, connecting multiple LANs.

**Typical usage:** Enables long-distance communication and connection between geographically distant locations.

**Typical geographical size:** Spans cities, countries, or continents.

# Internet :globe_with_meridians:

**What it is:** The Internet is a global network connecting millions of networks worldwide, allowing communication and information exchange.

**IP Address:** An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network for identification and addressing purposes.

**Types of IP Addresses:** IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) are the two types of IP addresses.

**Localhost:** It refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1), allowing a device to connect to itself.

# Subnet :triangular_ruler:

**What it is:** A subnet is a logical division of a larger network into smaller, more manageable segments.

**Why IPv6 was created:** IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a larger address space.

---

# TCP/UDP :signal_strength:

**What they are:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP suite.

**Main difference:** TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable data delivery, while UDP is connectionless, providing faster but less reliable communication.

---

# Port :door:

**What it is:** A port is a numerical identifier for a specific process or service on a device.

**Memorized port numbers:** SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).

---

# Tool/Protocol for Checking Network Connection :wrench:

**Common tool/protocol:** Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
